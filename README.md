# Binary Program Interpreter and Generator

This project consists of two main scripts: 
1. `assembler.py` - Generates a binary program file with custom instructions.
2. `inter.py` - Interprets the binary program file and simulates its execution.

---

## Features

### `assembler.py`:
- Generates a binary file (`program.bin`) containing a simple program with predefined commands.
- Commands included:
  - `WRITE` - Writes a value to a specified memory address.
  - `COMPARE ">"` - Compares a memory value with a given number and stores the result in memory.

### `inter.py`:
- Interprets the generated binary file and executes commands.
- Supports commands like `WRITE` and `COMPARE`.
- Outputs the memory state to a JSON file for further analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wallrat1/binary-interpreter.git
   cd binary-interpreter
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate a Binary File
Run the `assembler.py` script to create a binary file (`program.bin`) containing the instructions:
```bash
python3 assembler.py
```

### Step 2: Interpret the Binary File
Run the `inter.py` script to interpret the binary file and execute the instructions:
```bash
python3 inter.py program.bin output.json
```

- `program.bin`: Input binary file generated by `assembler.py`.
- `output.json`: Output file containing the memory state in JSON format.

## How It Works

### Example Workflow
1. **Binary Generation (`assembler.py`)**:
   - A vector is initialized in memory at a predefined start address.
   - A series of comparison operations are encoded into the binary file.

2. **Binary Interpretation (`inter.py`)**:
   - The binary file is parsed byte-by-byte.
   - Commands like `WRITE` and `COMPARE ">"` are executed, modifying the virtual memory.

3. **Memory Output**:
   - After execution, the memory state is saved in `output.json`.

## File Descriptions

- `assembler.py`:
  - Generates the binary file with commands for initializing and manipulating memory.
  - Example initialization:
    - A vector of values is written to memory.
    - Each value in the vector is compared to a number, and the result is stored.

- `inter.py`:
  - Interprets the binary file and simulates its execution in a virtual memory environment.
  - Outputs detailed logs of each operation to the console.

---

## Example Configuration

### Input Binary Program
- **Commands**:
  - Write values `[110, 112, 115, 116, 113, 117]` to memory starting at address 50.
  - Compare each value in the vector to the number `114`.

### Output Memory (JSON)
Example `output.json`:
```json
{
    "50": 110,
    "51": 112,
    "52": 115,
    "53": 116,
    "54": 113,
    "55": 117,
    "56": 0,
    ...
}
```
